# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PrintStruct! 🎉

We welcome all kinds of improvements - from bug fixes and formatting to new features and documentation.


## Coding Guidelines

- Follow the existing Python style and structure in the project.

- Add docstrings to functions and comments where appropriate.

- If you add a new feature, include examples in the README where possible.

- Keep your PR focused on a single logical change.


## Blocked Issues Policy

If an issue is blocked by other work (e.g., depends on another issue to be resolved first), it will be marked with a Blocked label or listed as “Blocked by #…”.

Do not start working on blocked issues until all blocking issues are closed or confirmed resolved.

This helps avoid wasted effort and unreviewable PRs.


## Communication

Feel free to ask questions in Issues or Discussions — the admin and community are here to help!
